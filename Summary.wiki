NOTE THIS IS NOT YET COMPLETE, EMAIL jmosborne@unimelb.edu.au WITH ANY QUSTIONS.

The code to run The multiple simulations, which were used to produce Figure 2, can be found here [wiki:PaperTutorials/EMBC2016/AnalyticComparison TestAnalyticComparisonLiteratePaper.hpp]
The code to run single simulations, which was used to produce Figure 3, can be found here [wiki:PaperTutorials/EMBC2016/ExampleSimulation TestExampleSimulationLiteratePaper.hpp]

Before looking at this, you may wish to look at some of the [wiki:UserTutorials basic user tutorials] for Chaste.

== Getting the code and installing dependencies ==

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.3].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on [wiki:InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage]. 
Note that Chaste is only fully supported on !Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X may need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO INSTALL HEMELB. INSTRUCTIONS TO FOLLOW.


You will also need the source for the EMBC2016 project.  This can be done by checking out the version from the repository by using the command 
{{{
svn checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/EMBC2016
}}}
in the projects folder of the Chaste directory. You will need to use the supplied username and password.

Now the project should be installed, and everything should compile and run correctly. 
You can now run the tests or simulations, or create your own test suites.

== Documentation ==
There are two folders - `src` and `test`.
 1. The `src` folder contains the classes necesary to run the simulation. These define the aditional forces and boundary conditions not in the core chaste code.
 1. The `test` folder contains:
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/EMBC2016/AnalyticComparison TestAnalyticComparisonLiteratePaper.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure 2.
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/EMBC2016/ExampleSimulation TestExampleSimulationLiteratePaper.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure 3.

 == Running tests ==
You can then run tests and simulations with,
{{{
cd <Chaste3.3 path>
scons b=GccOpt ts=projects/EMBC2016/test/TestAnalyticComparisonLiteratePaper.hpp
}}}
and 
{{{
scons b=GccOpt ts=projects/EMBC2016/test/TestExampleSimulationLiteratePaper.hpp
}}}
----
'''NB''': the paper was developed with release version 3.4. It will not work with with release version 3.3 or under.
